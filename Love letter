someone? Love letters are a classic gift that most women absolutely love. There is just something very romantic about the old fashioned way of expressing our emotions on paper. Although it is a gift that costs nothing, the fact that the words are coming from your heart will make the letter mean the world to your wife or girlfriend. Below are some tips for writing the perfect love letter.

Tip: When brainstorming ideas, ask yourself questions like:

- What are some things she does for you that you really appreciate?

- What would your life be like without her?

- What things do you love about her?

- How does she help you love yourself?

- What makes her the one for you?

- What do you hope the future holds for you and her?

- How does being with her help make you a better person?

Step One: Brainstorming
The reason that love letters are so cherished, is because it is an amazing feeling to read the words knowing they truly came from the heart. A love letter is not something that should be rushed, and some serious thought should be put into them. Your first step should be to just sit down with a piece of paper and a pencil and begin brainstorming all of the things that you would like to include in the letter. You don't have to worry about using proper wording or spelling in this step. Just jot down your thoughts and feelings. You don't even have to focus on being romantic. All you have to do is focus on being honest. Think about all the reasons why you love your wife or girlfriend. What things does she do that just makes you fall in love with her even more each day? Is she an awesome mother to your children? Does she always take care of you when you are sick? Does she always lend an ear when you need to vent? Does she always know how to make you laugh? Do you still get butterflies in your stomach when you kiss her?

Including memories in love letters is also a great idea. It shows that you truly have cherished every moment you have spent with her. In this step, jot down some of the strongest memories you have with her. What was your first date like? How did you meet her and what do you remember about this day? How did you celebrate your first holiday together? What struggles have you two helped each other get through? If you are having trouble, try looking at photographs to rekindle memories.

After you have finished brainstorming, just take a moment to sit back and think about the things you have written. It is important to get in touch with your emotional side. Think about all these things you love about her, and why this woman is your whole world.

Great Love Quotes to Include in Love Letters
Being deeply loved by someone gives you strength, while loving someone deeply gives you courage. -Lao Tzu

Love is just a word until someone comes along and gives it meaning.- Unknown

Tips
-Make sure to hand write your love letter. It is much more personal than typing it, and looks so much more romantic.

- Use your best handwriting. What good is a love letter if she can't read it?


- Making slight sexual references in the letter can be acceptable, but remember the point of this letter is to show her your romantic, loving side. Try to avoid any crude sexual content that strays away from this goal.

- Including your favorite photo of you and your wife of girlfriend in the envelop with the letter, is another great idea to make her smile.

Step 2: Write Your Letter
Now that you have thought about all the reasons this woman is your true love, you should be in the right mood to actually begin writing the letter. Any kind of paper will work for the letter, but fancy stationary paper can add a romantic touch. Using pen looks better than pencil. Use an erasable pen if you are prone to making mistakes.

Opening the letter

Make sure you choose an appropriate salutation. The opening of your love letter should set the romantic mood, and make her excited to keep reading. Just "Dear My Wife," does get the job done, but there are so many better options to consider. Say her name is Jane, here are some examples of good salutations to use with your love letter:

- To My Dearest Jane,

- To My Sweetheart,

- To My One and Only True Love,

- To My Beautiful Jane,


Writing the Love Letter

The first paragraph of the letter is very important. It sets the mood for the entire letter. Using your favorite romantic quote or favorite love song lyrics are great options for beginning a letter. Then tell her why you are writing the letter. Tell her why you want her to know how you really feel. Tell her how she is always on your mind and always in your heart. Good phrases to use in this paragraph include "I have been wanting to share these feelings with you for along time", "I am ready to open up my heart to you", "I wanted to give you something you can cherish", and "Please know that everything I am about to share comes not just from my brain, but from the very depths of my soul".

After you have opened your letter it is time to give it some body. The length of your letter is completely up to you. Although, it should be at least one page to show her that you really put some time and effort into this for her. The body of the letter is where you can share all of the things you brainstormed in step 1. Share all of your feelings, memories, and emotions with her. Do not hold back. She means the world to you, and now is the time to let her know.

The last paragraph is quite possibly the most important paragraph. It is the last thing that she will remember reading. Quickly summarize everything you have talked about throughout the letter and make an emphasis on the things you truly want her to remember. Tell her how much you are looking forward to your future together. You can end the letter with another favorite love quote, poem. lyric, or something you write for her yourself.


Closing the Letter

The closing salutation is just as important as the opening salutation. Here are some ideas:

- With Everlasting Love,

- With the Promise of Forever,

- Until the End of Time,

- With All of the Love in My Heart,

Step 3: Present Your Letter
Seal your love letter in an envelop and address it your wife or girlfriend. There are many romantic ideas for how to present it. You could send it to her in the mail. She will have a nice surprise when she opens a letter from her mailbox that's not a bill. You could place it on her pillow and lay a single rose on top of it. You could plan a romantic date and then give her the letter to end the perfect night. You know your special lady better than anyone else, so just use your imagination to come up with a great way to present your letter to her. She is bound to love this gift from the heart no matter how it is presented to her.
